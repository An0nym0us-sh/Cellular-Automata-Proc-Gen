# Cellular Automata Proc Gen


![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.6+-blue.svg)


Procedural generation of caves using cellular automata implemented in python

Controls:
- `Right Arrow` - Advance generation
- `Down Arrow` - Regenerate Noise

## Showcase

Basically we go from random noise (this):

To a finished looking map of a cave:
